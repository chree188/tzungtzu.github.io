<h3 id="spreading-of-economic-crisis"><strong><em>Spreading of Economic Crisis</em></strong></h3>

<p>Expanded the idea of SIS model in different areas and developed SIS model into transection network.</p>

<h3 id="scene-joint-recognition-and-object-locating-in-multi-robot-rescue-system"><strong><em>Scene Joint Recognition and Object Locating in Multi-robot Rescue System</em></strong></h3>

<p>The project plans to use some robots to build a rescue system platform in the lab to get the goal of joint scenarios recognition and object locating. Several robots can sampling and process information flexable by connecting with each other. With the help of intelligence fusion of multi-robot visual image information, ultrasound and infrared sensor, we can complete the scene joint recognition and object locating.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developed an self-localization algorithm which gradually improves the whole system by approaching the object as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Accomplish the intelligence fusion of different sensor and draw a outline of the map of the disaster area.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="robocup-rescue-simulations"><strong><em>Robocup Rescue Simulations</em></strong></h3>

<p>It aims to develop simulators that form the infrastruscture of the simulation system and emulate realistic phenomena predominant in disasters. And it aims to develop intelligent agents that are given the capabilities of the main actors in the disaster response scenario.</p>

<h3 id="human-brain-networking"><strong><em>Human Brain Networking</em></strong></h3>

<p>It is a functional idea of using data of RML(from ASML) to form a matrix and do research on these matrixes, find a general idea of Making things at the same level. Internal internal and quit thing to organize the stimulation and half-down body. It will soon gain port and en was.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>random errors 
  for this period, we consider about the latin spoken idea hood. and the figure shows that we should know as the time goes further, the robustness stays the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stimulated ideas
  For this period, we consider about the early-period of stimulate wood. it shows that the time consistly goes higher with the increase of cute.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>functional structures
  the time blender.</p>

Small note will tell that in my opinion is important and shows you that each row in this table and do not change and stand we quit and salt</p>

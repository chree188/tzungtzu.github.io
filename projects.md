###*Scene Joint Recognition and Object Locating in Multi-robot Rescue System*


<font face="helvetica"  size=2px >The project plans to use some robots to build a rescue system platform in the lab to get the goal of joint scenarios recognition and object locating. Several robots can sampling and process information flexable by connecting with each other. With the help of intelligence fusion of multi-robot visual image information, ultrasound and infrared sensor, we can complete the scene joint recognition and object locating.

 * Developed an self-localization algorithm which gradually improves the whole system by approaching the object as soon as possible.
 * Accomplish the intelligence fusion of different sensor and draw a outline of the map of the disaster area.

 ###*Robocup Rescue Simulation*

<font face="helvetica" size=2>It aims to develop simulators that form the infrastruscture of the simulation system and emulate realistic phenomena predominant in disasters. And it aims to develop intelligent agents that are given thecapabilities of the main actors in the disaster response scenario.
